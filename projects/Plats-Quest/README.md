## Project Details

### Vision
From Social to On-Chain: Plats Quest - A Polkadot-native quest platform, A marketing tool tailored for Polkadot Ecosystem & Aleph Zero network, A gateway to educate web2 users by unleashing the power of DOT, Tokens (ACA, GLMR, ASTR), and NFTs in Polkadot & AZERO through crypto rewards.
### Description
**Plats Quest** is a marketing tool, **Polkadot-native quest platform**, built on the **Polkadot blockchain**, some parachains like **Acala network, Moonbeam network, and Astar network as well as the Aleph Zero network**, focusing on quest campaigns and community building for projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, especially token holding and transaction increases. Plats Quest was born to spread the Polkadot ecosystem more widely, attracting more users, including both Web2 and Web3, through an **easy-to-use quest platform with transparent questing and rewarding**.

**Plats Quest has the following components and features:**

- **Quest Platform**: Plats Quest is designed specifically for projects within the Polkadot blockchain, Polkadot parachains (Acala network, Moonbeam network, and Astar network) and Aleph Zero network. This means it caters to the unique needs and requirements of Polkadot-based projects.

- **Social Quests**: Plats Quest provides social quests on platforms like Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. This is a wonderful marketing tool for projects on Polkadot.

- **On-Chain Quests**: On-chain quests are conducted directly on the Polkadot and Aleph Zero blockchains. We have the intention of offering some on-chain quests, including holding tokens, performing specific transactions, and minting NFTs. In this hackathon, we focus on Polkadot blockchain and its parachains (Acala network, Moonbeam network, and Astar network).

- **Community Building**: Community building plays an important role in every blockchain project's success. Plats Quest pays attention to helping projects engage and grow their communities through these quest campaigns.

Use of DOT, Tokens (ACA, GLMR, ASTR, AZERO): The platform allows for the use of DOT, as well as other tokens, particularly ACA, GLMR, ASTR, AZERO as rewards or incentives in quest campaigns. This can help attract and retain community members.
Automatic and Transparent Payments: Plats Quest employs smart contracts to automate and ensure the transparency of payments for quest participants. This is a key feature when manual intervention is eliminated and ensures that rewards are distributed fairly with predefined conditions.
Overall, Plats Quest appears to be a platform designed to foster engagement and interaction within the Polkadot ecosystem. By using social quests, on-chain quests, and native Polkadot and Aleph Zero assets as incentives, it aims to help projects within the Polkadot ecosystem and Aleph Zero community grow and strengthen their communities while automating the reward distribution process through smart contracts. This approach can enhance transparency and trust in the quest campaigns.
